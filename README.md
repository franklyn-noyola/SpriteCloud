# SpriteCloud Test Automation

#Introduction
This is my test automation project, In this project I  have validate the environment that was given (Web). In this readme file you'll find how to run those test files and also how to set Jenkins as the CI/CD tool to run those tests in a pipeline and provide the reports and results. Let's go for it.

<b>First Step<b></br>
Install Eclipse ID, you can download any eclipse what you like, in this case I have installed Eclipse for committers 2022. https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Clone the Github repo into your local machine from the master branch.

Install the following:

Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ - For this project I have installed the latest version (3.10.1) of python. (You can check the documentation to make sure you have installed Python properly for your corresponding OS)

Install or Upgrade your Pip - You can upgrade by using the command: python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Now with Pip installed/upgraded, install the following:

Robot Framework - command: pip install robotframework

Selenium Library- command: pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary

Requests Library - command: pip install robotframework-requests

JSON Library - comand: pip install robotframework-jsonlibrary

Now you are all set to run the test cases for the two environments. Let's move to the next thing.
